# Blog House
Inspired by Doge House. Taking blogs to the moon ðŸš€ ðŸŒ•

# Contribution guide:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone it to your development environnement
3. Make a .env file with the following key value pairs:

```
PORT=server-port

MONGO_URI=mongo-connection-string

JWT_KEY=anything

JWT_RESET_KEY=anything

EMAIL=gmail-email-adress

PASSWORD=gmail-password

URL=http://localhost:PORT

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

**Note:** Since we're using nodemailer for sending the verification email to registered users, we would recommend that you make a new gmail account, put the credentials in the .env file, then, in your account check the [Allow less secure apps to access account](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) option, by default this settings is off and you simply turn it on. Also you need to make sure that 2 factor authentication for the account is disabled.

*That's why we recommend making a new account*

**Another note:** Since we're using cloudinary for handling avatar image uploads, you're gonna need to make an account in https://cloudinary.com and create a cloud service, then you can get the cloud name, api key and api secret.

4. run `npm install`
5. run `node .` and your app should be on.
